Task 1: File Handling Utility

The first task focuses on understanding and implementing file handling operations in Java, which is a fundamental concept for any backend or system-level application. In this task, a Java program is developed to read, write, and modify text files using Java’s built-in I/O libraries. The program demonstrates how data can be stored persistently in files, retrieved when required, and updated efficiently. Concepts such as file streams, buffered readers and writers, exception handling, and file paths are applied to ensure smooth and error-free file operations. This task helps in gaining hands-on experience with real-world scenarios like logging, configuration file management, and data storage, which are commonly used in enterprise-level applications.

Task 2: REST API Client

The second task is aimed at building an understanding of RESTful web services and how Java applications interact with external systems. In this task, a Java application is created to consume a public REST API, such as fetching weather or similar real-time data. The application sends HTTP requests, handles responses, and parses JSON data into a readable and structured format. This task introduces concepts like HTTP methods, API endpoints, request-response cycles, JSON parsing, and data presentation. By completing this task, practical exposure to integrating third-party APIs is gained, which is a critical skill for modern Java developers working with microservices, cloud-based systems, and web applications.

Task 3: Multithreaded Chat Application

The third task involves designing and implementing a client-server chat application using Java Sockets and Multithreading. The server is responsible for handling multiple client connections simultaneously, while each client can send and receive messages in real time. Multithreading is used to ensure that multiple users can communicate without blocking each other. This task helps in understanding networking concepts, socket communication, thread lifecycle, and synchronization. It also demonstrates how real-time communication systems work behind the scenes. This task is especially useful for developing skills required in distributed systems, messaging platforms, and collaborative applications.

Task 4: AI-Based Recommendation System

The fourth task focuses on building a basic recommendation system using Java, introducing concepts related to artificial intelligence and machine learning. In this task, a recommendation engine is developed to suggest products or content based on user preferences or historical data. Libraries such as Apache Mahout are used to implement recommendation algorithms. Sample data is processed to generate meaningful suggestions. This task provides insight into how recommendation systems work in real-world applications like e-commerce platforms, streaming services, and content-based systems. It also helps in understanding data analysis, algorithmic thinking, and the application of AI concepts using Java.
